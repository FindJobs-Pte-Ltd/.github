# FindJobs-Pte-Ltd

FindJobs, a member of The Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE) develops mobile apps in different languages to connect jobs to non-executive jobseekers effectively. Together with NTUCâ€™s e2i (Employment and Employability Institute), FindJobs also developed and piloted a smart job kiosk to assist offline resident jobseekers who do not have a smartphone or data plan to access easily to nearby job opportunities. We believe strongly in delivering jobs to the community in order to meet the needs of individuals, and strive in connecting offline jobseekers and online employers together.
